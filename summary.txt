This file map the project life cycle. All the decisions that I made under this project, I am highlighting here for the traceability.

eda visualization notebook
- carry a data analysis on data set to see the data behaviour
- imported data set 
- imported libraries for dataframes and visualization
- first analysis is to sales data set 
- descriptive analysis on sales data set
- number of products in the data set is much bigger
- did analysis on first five of products of high price
- the number of sales is very low in high values products
- therefore, choosed most frequent/ high demand first five products
- visualized the price of first five frequent products
- it showed some temporal pattern. visualized the price of each product within a month
- the price variation has temporal pattern
- visualized the quantity of each product sold within a month
- the demand for our products is high in Monday and Tuesday. less demand in sunday
- plot price variation for selected five products taking the whole data set 
- plot quantity/ number of products sold of top five products taking the whole data set
- save dataframes for prediction purposes

ts-analysis notebook
- created notebook for time series analysis
- conducetd stationarity test for selling price
- product A did not stationary but others did
- the demand for all five products is non-stationary
- obtained acf and pacf for both data frames
- need to transform non-stationary series to stationary
- saved data set as pivot tables to training purposes
